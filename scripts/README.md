   - Add a "Control Script" component
   - Copy and paste the contents of `q-sys-crosspoint-control.lua`

2. **Create Required Controls**:
   - `Controls["IP Address"]` (String): IP address of NMOS Crosspoint Router
   - `Controls["Connection status"]` (String): Connection status display
   - `Controls["CIP-Status"]` (String): Matrox CIP status (optional)
   - `Controls["Encoder"]` (String or Array): Encoder device names (comma-separated or array)
   - `Controls.Decoder` (Array of String): Decoder device names
   - `Controls.DecoderSource` (Array of String/Knob/Combo): Source selection for each decoder
   - `Controls.Multiviewer` (Array of Boolean): Per-decoder multiviewer toggle controls

3. **Optional Controls**:
   - `Controls.Code` (String): JSON preset input for advanced commands

## Configuration

### Basic Settings

```lua
-- Router credentials (modify as needed)
ROUTER_USER = "admin"
ROUTER_PASSWORD = "password"

-- Debug and monitoring flags
DEBUG_ENABLED = false      -- Set true for verbose logging
ENABLE_PATCH_STATS = false -- Set true for patch statistics

-- Network configuration
ROUTER_PORT = 80           -- WebSocket port (default 80)
RECONNECT_INTERVAL = 5     -- Seconds between reconnect attempts
MAX_RECONNECT_INTERVAL = 60 -- Maximum reconnect interval
```

### Network Configuration

1. Set the IP address in `Controls["IP Address"]` to your NMOS Router server
2. Ensure proper network routing between Q-SYS Core and NMOS Router
3. Configure firewall rules to allow WebSocket connections (default port 80)
4. Configure encoder names in `Controls["Encoder"]` (comma-separated string or array)
5. Set up decoder names in the `Controls.Decoder` array

## Usage

### Connection Process

1. **Initial Connection**: The script automatically attempts to connect when loaded
2. **Authentication**: Uses SHA256 password hashing with server-provided seed
3. **Channel Subscription**: Subscribes to `mediadevices` and `mediadevmatroxcip` channels
4. **Real-time Updates**: Receives patch-based updates for device state changes
5. **Automatic Reconnection**: Implements exponential backoff for failed connections

### Making Connections

The script provides multiple methods for creating connections between encoders and decoders, from simple individual connections to complex batch operations.

#### Method 1: Manual Control (Individual Connections)

Use the Q-SYS control interface for simple, one-at-a-time connections:

- **Controls**: `Controls.DecoderSource[n]` dropdown controls (one per decoder)
- **Options**: Each dropdown contains all available encoders plus "-- DISCONNECT --"
- **Operation**: Select an encoder name to connect, or "-- DISCONNECT --" to break connection
- **Automatic**: Changes are immediately sent to the NMOS Router via WebSocket API

**Example Workflow**:
1. `Controls.DecoderSource[1]` → Select "Studio_Camera_1" → Connects to `Controls.Decoder[1]`
2. `Controls.DecoderSource[2]` → Select "Remote_Camera_2" → Connects to `Controls.Decoder[2]`
3. `Controls.DecoderSource[3]` → Select "-- DISCONNECT --" → Disconnects `Controls.Decoder[3]`

#### Method 2: JSON Presets (Batch Operations)

Use `Controls.Code` (String) for advanced batch operations and complex routing scenarios:

##### Single Connection
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "route": "makeconnection",
  "data": {
    "source": "Studio_Camera_1",
    "destination": "Decoder_Main"
  }
}
```

##### Multiple Connections (Batch)
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "route": "makeconnection",
  "data": {
    "multiple": [
      {"source": "Camera_1", "destination": "Decoder_1"},
      {"source": "Camera_2", "destination": "Decoder_2"},
      {"source": "Camera_3", "destination": "Decoder_3"},
      {"source": "Camera_4", "destination": "Decoder_4"}
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Batch Operations

All batch operations use the same `makeconnection` route with a `multiple` array. Each operation is a simple `{"source": "...", "destination": "..."}` object.

**Core Pattern:**
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "route": "makeconnection", 
  "data": {
    "multiple": [
      {"source": "Source_Name", "destination": "Destination_Name"}
    ]
  }
}
```

**Examples:**

```json
// One-to-Many: Connect one source to multiple destinations
{
  "method": "POST",
  "route": "makeconnection",
  "data": {
    "multiple": [
      {"source": "Main_Camera", "destination": "Decoder_1"},
      {"source": "Main_Camera", "destination": "Decoder_2"},
      {"source": "Main_Camera", "destination": "Decoder_3"}
    ]
  }
}

// Mass Disconnect: Use empty source "" to disconnect
{
  "method": "POST", 
  "route": "makeconnection",
  "data": {
    "multiple": [
      {"source": "", "destination": "Decoder_1"},
      {"source": "", "destination": "Decoder_2"},
      {"source": "", "destination": "Decoder_3"}
    ]
  }
}

// Mixed Operations: Connect and disconnect in one batch
{
  "method": "POST",
  "route": "makeconnection", 
  "data": {
    "multiple": [
      {"source": "Camera_1", "destination": "Decoder_A"},
      {"source": "", "destination": "Decoder_B"},
      {"source": "Camera_3", "destination": "Decoder_C"}
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Flow-Specific Connections
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "route": "makeconnection",
  "data": {
    "multiple": [
      {"source": "Camera_1", "destination": "Decoder_Main.v1"},
      {"source": "Audio_Mix", "destination": "Decoder_Main.a1"}
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Connection Naming and Addressing

The system supports flexible device addressing for robust operation:

**Device Identification Methods**:
- **Serial Number**: `"CIP-ENC-123"`, `"YXA00634"`
- **Device Name**: `"Studio Camera 1"`, `"Main Decoder"`
- **Device Alias**: `"Cam1"`, `"MainOut"`
- **Numeric ID**: `"123"`, `"634"`

**Flow Addressing** (optional):
- **Video Flows**: `"DeviceName.v1"`, `"DeviceName.v2"`
- **Audio Flows**: `"DeviceName.a1"`, `"DeviceName.a2"`
- **Data Flows**: `"DeviceName.d1"`, `"DeviceName.d2"`
- **Channel Numbers**: `"DeviceName.1"`, `"DeviceName.2"` (multiviewer)

#### Error Handling and Validation

**Automatic Validation**:
- Device names are validated against discovered NMOS devices
- Invalid connections are rejected with error messages
- Network connectivity issues trigger automatic reconnection
- Malformed JSON presets generate parsing error messages

**Common Error Scenarios**:
```json
// ❌ Invalid - Device not found
{"source": "NonExistent_Camera", "destination": "Decoder_1"}

// ❌ Invalid - Malformed JSON
{"source": "Camera_1" "destination": "Decoder_1"}  // Missing comma

// ✅ Valid - Proper format and existing devices
{"source": "Studio_Camera_1", "destination": "Main_Decoder"}
```

#### Batch Operation Best Practices

**Performance Optimization**:
- Group related connections into single batch operations
- Use `multiple` array for connecting more than 3 encoder/decoder pairs
- Avoid rapid successive individual connections (use batching instead)
- Monitor debug logs for connection confirmation

**Workflow Recommendations**:
1. **Planning**: Identify all source-destination pairs before starting
2. **Validation**: Verify device names using Q-SYS debug logs or device lists
3. **Testing**: Test small batches (2-3 connections) before large operations
4. **Monitoring**: Enable debug logging during initial setup and troubleshooting
5. **Documentation**: Keep JSON presets saved for repeated routing scenarios

### Matrox Convert IP Multiviewer Control

The script provides comprehensive multiviewer control for Matrox Convert IP devices, enabling multiple encoders to be patched to a single decoder for multiviewer display:

**Core Features**:
- **Per-Decoder Toggles**: Each decoder has its own multiviewer toggle (`Controls.Multiviewer[n]`)
- **Automatic Master Mode**: When multiviewer is enabled, master mode is automatically activated
- **Device Identification**: Supports device lookup by serial number, device name, or alias
- **WebSocket API Integration**: Uses crosspoint router API instead of direct device HTTP calls
- **Multiple Connection Methods**: Supports both postfix channel and flow type notation
- **Batch Operations**: Enable multiviewer and connect multiple encoders in single operations

##### Multiviewer Connection Methods

Connect encoders to multiviewer decoders using JSON batch operations with postfix or flow type notation:

**Postfix Channel Numbers:**
```json
{
  "method": "POST", 
  "route": "makeconnection",
  "data": {
    "multiple": [
      {"source": "Encoder1", "destination": "CIP-DEC-740.1"},
      {"source": "Encoder2", "destination": "CIP-DEC-740.2"},
      {"source": "Encoder3", "destination": "CIP-DEC-740.3"},
      {"source": "Encoder4", "destination": "CIP-DEC-740.4"}
    ]
  }
}
```

##### Channel Notation Formats

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Postfix Numbers | `CIP-DEC-740.1` | Simple channel numbers (1, 2, 3, 4...) |
| Video Flows | `CIP-DEC-740.v1` | NMOS video flow notation |
| Audio Flows | `CIP-DEC-740.a1` | NMOS audio flow notation |
| Data Flows | `CIP-DEC-740.d1` | NMOS data flow notation |

**Debug Output**: Enable debug logging to see detailed multiviewer operation logs including device lookup, API calls, and status changes.

**Troubleshooting**:
- Verify device is reachable and has multiviewer license installed
- Check WebSocket connection status
- Enable debug logging for detailed operation tracking
- Ensure correct device serial number/name in decoder controls
- For batch connections, verify all encoder names are valid

### Supported Commands

- **Individual Connections**: Select encoder for each decoder via `Controls.DecoderSource` dropdowns
- **Disconnect**: Select "-- DISCONNECT --" option to clear decoder connection
- **JSON Presets**: Use `Controls.Code` for batch operations and complex routing
- **Multiviewer Toggle**: Per-decoder multiviewer enable/disable via `Controls.Multiviewer` array
- **Batch Multiviewer**: Use `ConnectToMultiviewer()`, `ConnectToMultiviewerFlows()`, or `SetupMultiviewer()` functions

## API Integration

### WebSocket Messages

The script handles several message types from the NMOS Router:

- **authseed**: Server-provided seed for SHA256 password hashing
- **authok**: Successful authentication confirmation
- **sync**: Initial data synchronization for subscribed channels
- **patch**: Incremental JSON Patch updates to device state
- **response**: Server responses to API requests
- **ping/pong**: Keep-alive messages
- **authfailed/autherror**: Authentication failure notifications



## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **Check IP Address**: Verify `Controls["IP Address"]` is correct
2. **Network Connectivity**: Test ping from Q-SYS Core to NMOS Router
3. **WebSocket Port**: Ensure port 80 (or configured port) is accessible
4. **Authentication**: Verify username/password in script configuration

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging by setting:
```lua
DEBUG_ENABLED = true
```

This will provide verbose output in Q-SYS logs for troubleshooting.

### Common Error Messages

- **"Failed to decode JSON"**: Check network connectivity and server response
- **"Authentication failed"**: Verify credentials in `ROUTER_USER` and `ROUTER_PASSWORD`
- **"Connection timeout"**: Check firewall and network routing to port 80
- **"Control 'X' not found"**: Ensure required Q-SYS controls are created
- **"IP Address control is empty"**: Set the router IP address in the control

### Device Discovery Issues

1. **No devices found**: Check `mediadevices` and `mediadevmatroxcip` subscriptions
2. **Missing encoder names**: Configure `Controls["Encoder"]` with device names
3. **Decoder control mismatch**: Ensure `Controls.Decoder` and `Controls.DecoderSource` arrays match
4. **Stale device list**: Check patch processing and UI update throttling

### Matrox Convert IP Multiviewer Issues

1. **Multiviewer toggle not working**: Verify `Controls.Multiviewer` array exists and matches decoder count
2. **Device not found errors**: Check device serial number formats and ensure device is discoverable
3. **Master mode not activating**: Verify automatic master mode enable is working (check debug logs)
4. **API authentication failures**: Confirm Matrox device credentials are correct in backend
5. **Multiviewer license not installed**: Check device capabilities and license status
